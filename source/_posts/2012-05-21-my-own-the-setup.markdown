I enjoy the site "[The Setup](http://usesthis.com)", as it shows the hardware setups that people use to get thigns done. It is nice to know that others enjoy being as specific about their hardware and software configurations that I do. In economic terminology, I invest human capital in the form of my own efforts, and my usage of technology is a multiplier on that human capital. Thus, the better I am at utilizing the technology around me, the more productive I can be in a given amount of time. Of course, in real life there are adjustment costs, short term demands, and all sorts of other things that can lead each of us, via our internal dynamic programming that our brains do, to invest in our personal use of technology at different levels.  

Please enjoy [my "The Setup"](http://steve.planetbarr.com/wordpress/?page_id=8).
