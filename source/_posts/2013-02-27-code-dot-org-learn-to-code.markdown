Go visit [code.org](http://www.code.org/). The video below is the introduction to the site. It is a brief video featuring many industry leaders advocating the benefits of learning how to code. I wholeheartedly agree with and endores the content of the video. Learning to code empowers you in a way that is unparalleld, because you can create something and then **scale it immediately**. This is the most exciting time in the history of civilization. Learn to code! Learn to be a producer of knowledge!
