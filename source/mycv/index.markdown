## Current Occupation

I am currently completing my PhD in Operations Management at the Foster School of Business, University of Washington.


##  Research Interests

### Intersection of Operations Managment and Machine Learning
+ Founder of Center for Maching Learning in Operations Management ([CEMLOR](http://www.cemlor.org))

### Programming
+ High performance distributed computingcomputing (Map-Reduce and custom frameworks)
+ Numerical and statistical programming
+ Languages: Haskell (Data Parallel Haskell), R, C/C++ (OpenMP, OpenMPI), Matlab/Octave, Python, Perl
+ Experience with Hadoop and Hadoop Streaming
+ Very experienced with using Amazon Web Services (AWS) for large scale (6000+) core simulations. I have implemented my own Python-based framework for pushing jobs to SQS, launching EC2 instances, pushing the results to S3, and gathering and processing the results.

### Theory

+ Machine learning
+ Probabilistic graphical models
+ Decision modeling
+ Convex optimizaiton
+ Numeric optimization
+ Dynamic programming
+ Optimal control theory 
+ Dynamic games and discrete choice models
+ Classical and Bayesian statistics (regression, maximum likelihood estimation, Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), indirect inference and Simulated Method of Moments (SMM))
